## âœ… What you'll find

### 1. Complexity Cheat Sheet
- `BigO-CheatSheet.md`: Complexity of popular algorithms (time + space)
- Examples: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), O(2^n)

### 2. Core Categories
- **Sorting:** bubble, insertion, merge, quick, radix
- **Searching:** linear, binary, exponential
- **Recursion:** fibonacci, permutations
- **DP:** knapsack, longest subsequence, coin change
- **Graph:** BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, topological sort, MST
- **String:** KMP, Rabin-Karp, Trie
- **Bitwise:** xor tricks, bit masks
- **Math:** GCD, sieve, power mod

### 3. Data structures (with implementation)
- Stack, Queue
- Linked List
- HashMap
- Heap
- BST
- Trie
- DSU (Disjoint Set)
- Segment Tree

### 4. Interview Patterns
- Sliding window
- Two pointers
- Fast & slow

## ðŸ’¡ Reason
This repository focuses on providing clean, efficient, and well-documented implementations and learning patterns to:
- Practice and understand core CS concepts
- Prepare for job interviews
- Analyze and explain time/space complexity
- Demonstrate your understanding with code

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing
Each module has accompanying unit tests to verify correctness. Tests include edge cases and performance-critical inputs.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Use `notebooks/InterviewPatterns.md` for problem-solving templates.
- This repo is designed for C# implementations, but patterns are language-agnostic.
- See `DataStructure-Selection.md` for trade-offs and use-case guidelines.
